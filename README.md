UI flows:
• Characters must be listed on the main page (name and image)
• At the beginning 20 characters must be displayed, 10 more characters must be displayed for each scroll to the end of the page. Total of 40 characters should be listed.
• Clicking on the characters should go to the detail page. On this page there should be a list of the character's name, image, location, and the last five section names in which the character appears.
• There should be a back button on the detail page, and when clicked, send the user to the main page.
